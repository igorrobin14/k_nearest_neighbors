Could you please look at all these algorithms used for ball tree construction and traversing (written in Eiffel language)
and tell what the letters (name of variables) you think are refering to. I don't want you to give me the corresponding code in another more modern language
and I would like you to explain how these algorithms work together to perform a nearest neighbor search query.
Moreover, you should know maybe some of the instruction are partially incorrect (I hope not), so there is maybe a missing semicolon or letter somewhere
and you should also take into account the comment in the code
Finally, I know a 'BALL' object consists of a vector 'ctr' which holds the center of the ball and a real value 'r' containing the radius of the ball. 'BLT_ND' objects
consist of a BALL 'bl', and pointers 'par', 'lt', 'rt' to the node's parents and children. 'BALL_TREE' objects have a pointer 'tree' to the underlying tree and a variety of other slots to enhance retrievals (such as local priority queues and caches: by the way, what are these ?)
